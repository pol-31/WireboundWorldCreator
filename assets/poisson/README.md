Poisson points were generated here:
https://github.com/corporateshark/poisson-disk-generator
then I've converted them to png (to reduce the size),
and then textures were made cyclic (for seamless tiling),
and then randomize color (simple c++ script, not here)
TODO: (explain/mention resolution, density, program params)

we also can store 3 samples/images of points in a single texture (3 channels),
but currently we haven't even decided which to use in the game.
